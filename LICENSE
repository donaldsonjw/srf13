;;; The prefix/suffix and comparison routines in this code had (extremely
;;; distant) origins in MIT Scheme's string lib, and was substantially
;;; reworked by Olin Shivers (shivers@ai.mit.edu) 9/98. As such, it is
;;; covered by MIT Scheme's open source copyright. See below for details.
;;; 
;;; The KMP string-search code was influenced by implementations written
;;; by Stephen Bevan, Brian Dehneyer and Will Fitzgerald. However, this
;;; version was written from scratch by myself.
;;;
;;; The remainder of this code was written from scratch by myself for scsh.
;;; The scsh copyright is a BSD-style open source copyright. See below for
;;; details.
